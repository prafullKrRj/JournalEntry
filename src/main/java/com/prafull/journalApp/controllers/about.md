# JournalEntryController

A controller in Spring Boot is a class that handles incoming HTTP requests and sends responses back to the client. It
acts as an intermediary between the client and the server-side logic. The main objectives of a controller are:

1. **Handling Requests**: Controllers map HTTP requests to handler methods using annotations
   like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, and `@DeleteMapping`.
2. **Processing Input**: They process input data from the client, often in the form of request parameters, headers, or
   request bodies.
3. **Returning Responses**: Controllers return responses to the client, which can be in various formats like JSON, XML,
   or HTML.
4. **Interacting with Services**: They often delegate business logic to service classes, keeping the controller focused
   on handling HTTP requests and responses.
5. **Validation**: Controllers can validate input data to ensure it meets certain criteria before processing it further.
6. **Exception Handling**: They can handle exceptions that occur during request processing and return appropriate error
   responses.

In the context of the `JournalEntryController`, it performs the following actions:

- **Get All Entries**: Retrieves all journal entries.
- **Get Single Entry**: Retrieves a single journal entry by its ID.
- **Create Entry**: Adds a new journal entry.
- **Update Entry**: Updates an existing journal entry by its ID.
- **Delete Entry**: Deletes a journal entry by its ID.

This controller uses a temporary in-memory database (`tempDB`) to store journal entries, which is useful for development
and testing purposes.

For future purposes, you might want to:

- **Integrate with a Database**: Replace the in-memory database with a persistent database like MongoDB or MySQL.
- **Add Security**: Implement authentication and authorization to secure your endpoints.
- **Enhance Validation**: Add more robust validation for input data.
- **Implement Pagination**: Add pagination for endpoints that return lists of entries.
- **Improve Error Handling**: Implement global exception handling to manage errors more effectively.
